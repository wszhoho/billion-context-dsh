## Why?

When conversations get long, the model runs out of context. Most tools hard-truncate — silently dropping earlier messages. **billion-context-dsh** gives the model a `compress` tool: the LLM decides **when** and **what** to compress into high-fidelity summaries, preserving critical details (file paths, decisions, error strings) while reclaiming context space.

Unlike DSH's built-in auto-compaction (which replaces a range with an automatically generated summary), billion-context-dsh:

- **Model-driven** — the model writes the summary itself; there is no second LLM summarization call
- **Advisory, never imperative** — automatic policy only *nudges*; the model decides whether and when to compress
- **Durable & recoverable** — a compressed range becomes a checkpoint node, the originals stay in the append-only session log; `decompress` restores them, `search_context` finds information inside blocks
- **Long tasks hold steady** — every step builds on the results before it; key conclusions stay usable and compound, so very long tasks actually finish
- **Context stays lean** — every request rides on a small, distilled slice of context with only the key information; no bulk compression of large ranges, so details don't decay with it — and tokens stay low

This is the DeepSeek Harness port of [billion-context-pi](https://github.com/ranxianglei/billion-context-pi) (the Pi coding-agent adapter): the compression core ([acp-kernel](https://github.com/ranxianglei/acp-kernel)) is reused verbatim, and the adapter layer was rewritten against DSH's durable-surface model — see [docs](https://github.com/Tyan66666/billion-context-dsh/tree/main/docs) for the verified mapping.

## Install

> 💡 **Want DeepSeek Harness to install it for you?** This repo itself runs on DSH: hand [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) to an agent in a session and it will read the guide, inspect your profile, wire the composition, and verify the mount. Two preconditions: ① the config lives under `~/.dsh`, so you approve one file-permission prompt; ② afterwards ask it to call `acp_status` as proof.

**Path A (recommended): one-command install via the DSH store / `dsh plugin` (bundle) — globally active right after install, zero configuration.**

Click install in DSH's plugin store, or run:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add billion-context-dsh
```

The command installs the package and automatically layers this package's bundle patch ([cordis.patch.yml](cordis.patch.yml)) into the profile's composition. The patch does two things:

- **Disables the host `compaction-basic`** — so two backends do not both register `ctx.compaction` in the same realm (modern DSH web bundles already ship this disable; the row is an idempotent safety net that holds on every supported DSH);
- **Mounts the ACP engine at the HOST plane** — the four model tools (`compress` / `decompress` / `search_context` / `acp_status`), the `/acp` command, the advisory nudge, and the ACP guidance section reach **EVERY mode** of the profile (standard / code / minimal / cordis / custom presets). Window auto-detection and the tools/command/nudge defaults are all on — **no manual configuration needed**.

Restart `dsh` afterwards (bundle layers are composed at startup), open a new session, and verify: ask the model to call `acp_status`, or run `/acp status`. Shipped presets (standard / code / cordis) keep their realm-local `compaction-basic` fallback (automatic pressure compression still runs there; the ACP tools and nudge coexist); minimal and presets without a compaction realm use this engine directly.

> **DSH version compatibility.** The package declares all four runtime seam
> packages (`dsh-compaction` / `dsh-session` / `dsh-llm` / `dsh-tools`) as peer
> dependencies, sharing the range
> `^0.1.0-rc.6 || ^0.1.1-rc.1 || ^0.1.2-alpha.4`,
> covering the `0.1.0-rc.x` and `0.1.1-rc.x` release lines (including the current
> DSH release; the seam's `src/` is unchanged from `0.1.0-rc.6` to `0.1.1-rc.2`, so the public
> API is identical) and the `0.1.2-alpha.x` line (which removed the
> `Session.events` getter in favour of `snapshotEvents()` / `eventAt()`; this
> engine feature-detects both shapes, so one build runs on either seam). The
> range is multiple `||` clauses **on purpose**: npm
> (node-semver) only lets a prerelease version satisfy a range that carries a
> comparator on the SAME `[major, minor, patch]` tuple as the candidate, so a lone
> `^0.1.0-rc.6` can never match `0.1.1-rc.x` (issue #68) or `0.1.2-alpha.x` —
> older releases fail to install on DSH 0.1.1-rc.x / 0.1.2-alpha.x; upgrade to a
> release containing this fix. Declaring all four seam packages as peers (not
> just `dsh-compaction`) ensures that, even under pnpm's
> hoisted/linked layout, installations resolve them to the **host's own** copy
> rather than a stale nested copy inconsistent with the host.

**Path B: plain `npm install` (package only — a composition row is required).**

```bash
npm install billion-context-dsh
```

This only installs the package into your project/global store; it does **not** touch any profile — add a composition row as shown below or the engine never mounts.

**Install from the git source (`github:` spec — the form the plugin store shows).** The prebuilt `dist/` artifacts are committed to this repository, so a git-source install also works out of the box — **no build step needed**, and pnpm 11's default build-script blocking (`allowBuilds`) never applies to this package:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add github:Tyan66666/billion-context-dsh#v0.2.19
```

Prefer a `#<tag>` ref to get artifacts identical to that npm release; without a ref you get the latest default-branch build. Only building the repo yourself (`npm run build`) requires approving build scripts. Background and trade-offs: [docs/git-source-install-design.md](docs/git-source-install-design.md) (issue #92).

## Scope & customization

Two audiences: ① Path B (plain npm install) users, who must write a composition row; ② Path A users who want custom `config` (the bundle already ships sane defaults — override them with a SAME-ID row).

**Custom `config` (Path A bundle users).** Append a `compaction-acp` row with `config:` to your profile patch (e.g. `~/.dsh/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml`) — the same-id row overrides the bundle's default row:

```yaml
- id: compaction-acp
  name: 'billion-context-dsh'
  config:
    modelContextLimit: 128000   # optional; omit to auto-detect the model's real window (fallback 128000)
```

**Global — host plane, every mode** (recommended). This is what Path A's bundle already does; plain-npm users add all of the following (bundle users skip the first two rows):

```yaml
# ACP as the global compaction backend: four model tools + `/acp` command +
# nudge + ACP guidance section for EVERY mode
# (standard / code / minimal / cordis / custom presets).
# Must also disable the host compaction-basic: two backends providing
# `ctx.compaction` in the same realm collide.
# (The bundle install already ships these two rows.)
- id: compaction-basic
  disabled: true

- insert:
    - id: compaction-acp
      name: 'billion-context-dsh'
      config:
        modelContextLimit: 128000   # optional; omit to auto-detect the model's real window (fallback 128000)
```

**(Optional) Custom prompt copy — `config.prompts`.** Every model-visible prompt (normal/emergency nudge opener, context breakdown, growth line, batch tip, tier line, range table, the ACP system-prompt section, the four tool descriptions) defaults to **acp-kernel's own `renderNudgeText`** — the efficiency note, context breakdown, compression rules, and batch tip all come from the kernel verbatim; only the range table is swapped for the surface-seq version (the kernel uses mNNNNN refs, and DSH has no `<acp>` tags; the seq range table likewise carries a `[tool X% | text Y%]` composition share and oldest-first ordering, matching the kernel's display semantics). Overriding any nudge slot switches to template rendering. Templates support named placeholders (e.g. `{pct}` and `{philosophy}` for nudges, `{surface}` for the range table) and are **validated at construction**: a misspelled placeholder fails engine startup (fail-fast) instead of leaking a literal `{pct}` into the model context:

```yaml
      config:
        modelContextLimit: 128000
        prompts:
          nudge:
            normal: 'This is an efficiency nudge to compress early and keep context lean.'  # custom nudge opener
          tools:
            acpStatus: 'Report the ACP block ledger: compressed blocks, reclaimed tokens, and current context pressure.'  # custom tool description
```

See [docs/configurable-prompts-design.md](docs/configurable-prompts-design.md) for the full slot list, per-slot placeholders, and the empty-string/`null` semantics. Deployments that omit `prompts` use the kernel rendering directly (aligned with kernel/pi; see design doc v6).

**Per-mode — an agent preset's `compaction` realm.** First *disable (or delete) the realm's existing `dsh-compaction-basic` row*, then mount this engine — two backends cannot coexist in the same realm:

```yaml
# First disable the realm's default backend (or just delete this row)
- id: compaction-basic
  disabled: true

# Then mount this engine
- id: compaction-acp
  name: 'billion-context-dsh'
  config:
    modelContextLimit: 128000   # optional; omit to auto-detect the model's real window (fallback 128000)
```

> **One context manager per agent.** Two backends providing `ctx.compaction` collide — never run both in the same realm. Full install & verification guide: [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md).

## How it works

DSH derives every model request from its append-only session log (the *surface*). ACP semantics map onto that model directly:

| ACP concept | DSH implementation |
|---|---|
| `compress` tool shadows a range | durable `surfaceOp: { op: 'replace' }` — the model-written summary becomes a checkpoint node; the originals stay in the log |
| refs (`m00001` tags) | surface seqs, carried by the nudge's compressible-range table |
| nudge ("efficiency note — compress early and keep context lean") | injected at `agent/pre-step` by the kernel's pressure decision — efficiency note + context breakdown + compression rules, tone aligned with kernel/pi; never an order |
| `decompress` | read-only recovery of shadowed originals from the log |
| `search_context` | scores a unified doc set (block summaries + shadowed originals) rebuilt from the log via acp-kernel `searchBlocks` (hybrid: stemming + CJK bigrams + char n-gram fuzzy); hits link back to the owning block |
| `acp_status` | CONTEXT BREAKDOWN (tool/text/summaries shares of the visible total) + compressed-block ledger + nudge decision line + a `Checkpoint seqs` row mapping each ACTIVE block's kernel ref (`bN`) to its checkpoint summary seq — compressing a checkpoint seq distills that block (issue #60); no context-window rows; scope/view/tool/sort/limit drilldown supported |
| block state | in-memory kernel state + **log-rebuilt ledger** (no sidecar files) |
| tiered distillation (T2/T3) | re-compressing a block's summary node distills that block (tier 2); distilling a tier-2 block yields tier 3. Tier + kernel block ids are persisted to the log, so kernel state rehydrates from the log after a restart and stays distillable |
| compression accounting (shadow price) | `shadowedTokenCount` (what the host occupancy display deducts) is priced in the **host token-meter's vocabulary** (`ctx.tokenMeter.measure` preferred; exact mirror in `src/host-tokens.ts` as fallback) — never the plugin's internal CJK-aware estimate (that is display currency; mixing it into the host ledger can drive `messageTokens` negative and brick a CJK-heavy session, issue #54) |

The load-bearing compression guidance (tools, philosophy, summary rules, tier rules) is registered as a one-time system-prompt section; each nudge carries a condensed version (efficiency note + philosophy + context breakdown + HOW_TO_COMPRESS_RULES + range table + batch tip). There is deliberately **no automatic summarization**: automatic policy only nudges the model (`compactIfNeeded` returns null).

## Model-facing tools

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `compress` | Replace a seq range with a dense summary you write (edges auto-balanced to tool-pair boundaries); re-compressing a block's summary node distills it (tier 2/3) |
| `decompress` | Restore a previously compressed block's original content (read-only); accepts the `bN` ref shown by acp_status or a compaction id |
| `search_context` | Search compressed block summaries and originals by keyword (acp-kernel hybrid retrieval: stemming + CJK bigrams + fuzzy); hits link back to the owning block |
| `acp_status` | CONTEXT BREAKDOWN (tool/text/summaries shares of the visible total) + compressed-block ledger + nudge decision line + a `Checkpoint seqs` row mapping each ACTIVE block's kernel ref (`bN`) to its checkpoint summary seq (the distill entry point, issue #60); no context-window rows. Drilldown supported: `scope:"compressed"` per block, `scope:"uncompressed"` + `view:"messages"`/`"ranges"` per message/range, with `tool` filter, `sort` order and `limit` cap. Drilldown row refs are kernel ids (mN) — feed them straight to `compress` as `startSeq`/`endSeq` (auto-mapped to the live surface seq); `Surface:` seqs work too |
| `/acp` | status / compress / decompress from the command bar; status also shows human-side window info (estimated context, window source, compressed-block ledger, and **nudge arbitration** — `nudge: idle/ACTIVE — reason` plus how many tokens remain until the next nudge, decided by the same kernel turn as the nudge path) |

## Configuration

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `modelContextLimit` | auto-detected (fallback `128000`) | Context window used for the kernel's pressure decisions; an explicit value wins and skips detection. When omitted, the host session projection `contextPressure.contextWindow` is read first — the capacity disclosed for the **current real route** (a session that switched models follows automatically, no restart needed) — and the model API is probed only when the projection discloses no window; an explicit value also skips the output-reservation subtraction (the operator owns the denominator) |
| `autoModelContextLimit` | `true` | Resolve the real context window automatically: the host projection first (`windowFor` → `projectedContextWindow`, `src/window.ts`), then the model API probe (`agent.ctx.llm.resolveModelInfo`); both are skipped when `autoModelContextLimit: false`. On probe failure it falls back to the default, and the `/acp` command shows the window source (the `acp_status` model tool carries no window info). A failed probe is surfaced in the host log and the `/acp` panel (`restart to re-probe`) — the failure is cached like a success, so fixing the gateway requires a restart or an explicit `modelContextLimit` before the probe retries. On a successful probe the adapter's per-request output cap (`defaultMaxTokens` — the output reservation the provider guarantees at the end of the window) is SUBTRACTED, so every downstream pressure decision (nudge tiers, truncate, growth) measures usage against the SUSTAINABLE input budget (window − reservation): a 96K window with a 16K cap carries at most 80K of input, and the raw denominator understated usage by cap/window (≈17% there — and the ratio is far higher on short-window models, where the same cap is a quarter or more of the window). When the cap is undisclosed, the limit is explicit, or the probe fails, the raw-window behavior is kept; `/acp status` shows the subtraction (raw − reservation) |
| `nudgeMinContextLimitPct` | kernel default `0.45` | Nudge window lower bound (usage fraction) — validation only; the growth-driven trigger has no percentage floor — same default as billion-context-pi |
| `nudgeMaxContextLimitPct` | engine default `0.70` (kernel/pi default `0.75`) | Over-limit line: above this the nudge fires regardless of growth — deliberately below the host compaction-basic 80% auto-compaction line so the forced nudge fires first; an explicit value wins (a same-name key in `coreOverrides.nudge` outranks it — see below) |
| `nudgeEmergencyThresholdPct` | engine default `0.85` (kernel/pi default `0.95`) | Emergency nudge (bypasses the per-turn dedup) — lowered from `0.95`: at 95% the model has no room to act and the 80% auto-compaction line shadows it; an explicit value wins (a same-name key in `coreOverrides.nudge` outranks it — see below) |
| `coreOverrides` | — | Any other acp-kernel `Config` override (billion-context-pi's `coreOverrides` escape hatch). Merge order: kernel defaults → top-level pct knobs → `coreOverrides.nudge` lands last — same-name keys take its value |
| `autoTools` | `true` | Register the four model tools on `ctx.tools` |
| `autoCommand` | `true` | Register the `/acp` command on `ctx.commands` |
| `autoNudge` | `true` | Inject the nudge into `agent/pre-step` |
| `prompts` | — | (optional) Custom prompt copy: per-slot overrides for nudge / range table / system prompt / tool descriptions (template + named placeholders, validated at construction; see “Custom prompt copy” above and [docs/configurable-prompts-design.md](docs/configurable-prompts-design.md)) |
